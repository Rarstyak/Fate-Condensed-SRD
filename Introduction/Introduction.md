# Introduction

This is _Fate Condensed_, a version of _Fate Core System_ in as compact a form as we can manage. It is a complete roleplaying game; while other books might enhance your use of it, you don’t need any other book to play.

On that note, let’s get into what you _do_ need!

## What Do I Need to Play?

To play _Fate Condensed_ you’ll need two to six friends with one acting as Game Master (GM), some dice, some tokens, writing implements, paper, and something to write short notes on (_e.g.,_ small “sticky notes”).

_Fate Condensed_ uses **Fate Dice™** when characters take action. Fate Dice are six-sided dice with two `[0]` sides, two `[+]` sides, and two `[-]` sides. One set of four dice will work fine, but one set per player is ideal. Other alternatives exist, such as using standard six-sided dice (1-2 = `[-]`, 3-4 = `[0]`, 5-6 = `[+]`), or the **Deck of Fate**, which uses cards instead of dice. We use the word “roll” throughout the text for simplicity.

### For Veterans: Changes From Fate Core

Condensing the gist of a system from nearly 300 pages down to about 50 pages of text does lead to a few changes. As of this writing it has also been eight years since _Fate Core System_ was created, so a little iteration of the design is to be expected. In particular, we highlight the following:

- We’ve shifted over to **[one-point stress boxes](../Getting-Started/Create-Your-Characters/Stress-and-Consequences/Stress-and-Consequences.md)** to help reduce confusion.
- **[“Balsera Style” initiative](../Challenges-Conflicts-and-Contests/Setting-Up-Scenes/Turn-Order.md)** (also known as “elective action order” or “popcorn initiative”) is the default rather than using skills to determine turn order.
- [Advancement](../Advancement/Advancement.md) functions a little differently; we’ve eliminated significant milestones and finessed major ones (as breakthroughs) to compensate.
- We’ve removed the notion of active opposition as separate from the **[defend action](../Taking-Action-Rolling-the-Dice/Actions/Defend.md)**. This has a few minor ripple effects, particularly **[overcome’s tie result](../Taking-Action-Rolling-the-Dice/Actions/Overcome.md)**.
- **[Create an Advantage](../Taking-Action-Rolling-the-Dice/Actions/Create-an-Advantage.md)** has been tweaked to offer better clarity and agency around the discovery of existing unknown aspects.
- **[Full defense](../Optional-Rules/Full-Defense.md)** is presented as optional and has been altered a bit to accommodate the expanded scope of the defend action. Other **[standard rules options](../Optional-Rules/Optional-Rules.md)** are presented as well.
