## Faster Contests

Some groups may feel contests involve too many attempts to create advantages per exchange. For those groups, try the following method: In each exchange of a contest, each participant may choose only one of these three options:

- Make the **[overcome roll](../Taking-Action-Rolling-the-Dice/Actions/Overcome.md)** for their side.
- Roll to create an advantage, but no **[teamwork bonus](../Challenges-Conflicts-and-Contests/Teamwork/Teamwork.md)**.
- Provide their teamwork bonus to their side’s overcome roll or another’s attempt to create an advantage. Don’t roll.
