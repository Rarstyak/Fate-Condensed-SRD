### Situation Aspects

When setting the scene, the GM should think of interesting and dynamic environmental features that can constrain the action or provide opportunities to change the situation by using them. Three to five details are more than enough. Use these categories as a guide:

- **Tone, mood, or weather**—darkness, lightning, and howling winds
- **Impediments to movement**—connected by ladders, covered in slime, and filled with smoke
- **Cover and obstructions**—vehicles, pillars, and crates
- **Dangerous features**—crates of TNT, barrels of oil, and eldritch artifacts crackling with electricity
- **Usable objects**—improvised weapons, statues or bookshelves to knock over, and doors to be barred

Anyone can invoke and compel these aspects, so remember to take them into account when you wrestle that cultist to the ground amid the **Caustic Slime Covering Everything**.

More situation aspects can be written down as the scene plays out. If it makes sense that there are **Deep Shadows** in the recesses of the catacombs, go ahead and write that down when a player asks if there are any shadows they can use to hide. Other aspects come into play because characters use the create an advantage action. Things like **Flames Everywhere!** don’t just happen without character action. Well. Usually.

#### Free Invokes on the scene’s aspects?

It’s up to the GM to decide if a situation aspect arising from the scene’s setup provides a free invoke to the players (or even to the NPCs). Some of the scene’s aspects might provide a clever player just the advantage they need right away—and a free invoke can be a strong incentive to drive players to interact with the environment. Free invokes also might end up on the scene’s aspects at the start due to preparations made in advance.

#### Zone Aspects

A mentioned in **[Other Kinds of Aspects](../../Aspects-and-Fate-Points/Other-Kinds-of-Aspects/Other-Kinds-of-Aspects.md)**, Some situation aspects might apply to specific zones on the map, and not others. That’s okay—it can add some extra texture, opportunity, and challenge to the map that might be lacking otherwise.
