### Recovering from Conflicts

At the end of each scene, every character clears their stress boxes. Consequences take more time and effort to clear.

To start the **recovery process**, the person treating you will need to succeed at an overcome action with an appropriate skill. Physical injuries typically are addressed using medical knowledge via Academics, while mental consequences are healed with Empathy. This overcome action faces difficulty equal to the severity of the consequence: Fair (+2) for a mild consequence, Great (+4) for moderate, and Fantastic (+6) for severe. These difficulties increase by two when you’re trying to treat yourself (it’s easier to have someone else do that).

If you succeed on this roll, rewrite the consequence to indicate that it is healing. A **Broken Arm** may be rewritten as **Arm in a Cast**, for instance.

Success here is only the first hurdle—it takes time to clear the consequence.

- **Mild** consequences take one full scene after treatment to clear.
- **Moderate** consequences last longer, taking a full session after treatment to clear.
- **Severe** consequences only clear when you reach a **[breakthrough](../../../Advancement/Breakthroughs.md)** after treatment.
