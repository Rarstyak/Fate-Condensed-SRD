### Ending a Conflict

A conflict draws to a close when everyone on one side has either conceded or been taken out. At the end of a conflict, any players who conceded collect their fate points for the concession (**page XX**). The GM also pays out fate points owed to players for hostile invokes (**page XX**) that happened during the conflict.
