### Aspects

**Aspects** are short phrases that describe who your character is or what is important to them. They can relate to your character’s physical or mental qualities, history, beliefs, training, relationships, or even particularly important equipment.

The first thing to know about them is: **Aspects are true** (see **page XX** for a discussion of this). In other words, how you define your character is real and true in the story you’re telling. If you write down that your character is a **Precog Sniper**, then they _are_ a precog sniper. You’ve told everyone that your character sees the future and is a crack shot with a rifle.

You’ll also use aspects in play to change the story. They give you permission to improve your dice rolls and establish facts about the world. Lastly, aspects can earn you **fate points** if they create complications for your character—so to make the most versatile aspects, you should aim for ones that are double-edged, working both for you and against you.

To learn more about aspects and what makes a good one, consider reading some of [Aspects and Fate Points](../../../Aspects-and-Fate-Points/Aspects-and-Fate-Points.md).

**To begin, you’ll give your character five aspects**: a high concept, a trouble, a relationship, and two free aspects. Start with the high concept and go from there.
