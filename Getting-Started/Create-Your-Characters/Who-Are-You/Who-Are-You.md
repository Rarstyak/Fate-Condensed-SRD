### Who Are You?

Once you’ve decided on a setting, it’s time for the players to make characters—also called PCs. Each player takes on the role of one of the heroes of your story, controlling all their actions. You get to build the character you want to see in the world. Keep in mind that Fate characters are competent, dramatic, and willing to engage with the adventures ahead.

Your PC is made up of several elements:

- **[Aspects](../Aspects/Aspects.md):** phrases describing who your hero is
- **[Skills](../Skills/Skills.md):** your hero’s areas of relative expertise
- **[Stunts](../Stunts/Stunts.md):** remarkable things your hero does
- **Stress:** your hero’s ability to keep calm and carry on
- **Consequences:** the wounds, physical and mental, your hero can endure
- **[Refresh](../Refresh/Refresh.md):** a measure of your hero’s narrative agency
- **[Finishing Touches](../Finishing-Touches/Finishing-Touches.md):** your hero’s personal details
