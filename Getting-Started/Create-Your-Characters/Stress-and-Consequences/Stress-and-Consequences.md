### Stress and Consequences

**[Stress](../../../Challenges-Conflicts-and-Contests/Conflicts/Taking-Harm/Stress.md)** and **[Consequences](../../../Challenges-Conflicts-and-Contests/Conflicts/Taking-Harm/Consequences.md)** are how your character withstands the mental and physical toll of their adventures. Characters have at least three one-point boxes for physical stress and at least three one-point boxes for mental stress. They also get one slot each for mild, moderate, and severe consequences.

Your rating in Physique affects how many total physical stress boxes you have. Will does the same for your mental stress. Refer to the following table:

Physique/Will

Physical/Mental Stress

Mediocre (+0)

**`[1][1][1]`**

Average (+1) or Fair (+2)

**`[1][1][1] [1]`**

Good (+3) or Great (+4)

**`[1][1][1] [1][1][1]`**

Superb (+5) and higher

**`[1][1][1] [1][1][1]`** and a second mild consequence slot specifically for physical or mental hits

You’ll learn how stress and consequences work during play in **[Taking-Harm](../../../Challenges-Conflicts-and-Contests/Conflicts/Taking-Harm/Taking-Harm.md)**.

#### Hang on, that’s not what I remember!

In _Fate Condensed_, we’re using only one-point stress boxes. _Fate Core System_ and _Fate Accelerated_ both use a series of escalating-value boxes (one 1-point box, one 2-point box, etc). You can use that style of stress box if you like; for this version we decided to stick with one-point boxes because it’s simple—with the other method, folks can get confused just a little more easily.

There are a few other angles on this style that you’ll want to keep in mind.

- **[With 1-point stress boxes](../../../Challenges-Conflicts-and-Contests/Conflicts/Taking-Harm/Stress.md)** you may mark as many of them as you want when you get hit (the escalating-value style of Fate Core, meanwhile, has a “you can only mark one box per hit” proviso).
- This style goes with the Fate Core notion of separate Physical and Mental stress tracks, instead of a single unified track as with Fate Accelerated. If you’re inclined towards a unified track, add three more boxes to make up for it, and use the _higher_ of Physique or Will to lengthen it as indicated.
- Three points of stress absorption on one track is not a lot! If characters end up feeling a little fragile in play, you may want to add one or two boxes to the default quantity. It’s all about how fast the consequences hit. (With the older style, a **`[1][2]`** track absorbs 2 to 3 stress, **`[1][2][3]`** = 3 to 6, **`[1][2][3][4]`** = 4 to 10.)
