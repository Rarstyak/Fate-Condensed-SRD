## Other Kinds of Aspects

We’ve covered the standard aspect types in **[What Kinds of Aspects Are There](../What-Kinds-of-Aspects-Are-There/What-Kinds-of-Aspects-Are-There.md)**. These additional types are optional, but may add value to your game. To some extent these are variants on character aspects (if you expand your notion of what counts as a character) and situation aspects (if you change your notion of how long those last).

**Organization aspects:** Sometimes you might be dealing with a whole organization that operates under a certain set of principles. Consider giving the organization aspects which any member of it can access as if it were their own.

**Scenario aspects:** Sometimes a particular plot might introduce a new “trope” that shows up time and again in the storyline. Consider defining this as an aspect which is available to all characters in the story until that part of the story concludes.

**Setting aspects:** Like a scenario aspect, the setting of your campaign itself may have recurring themes. Unlike a scenario aspect, these aspects don’t go away.

**Zone aspects:** You can attach situation aspects to a particular place on the map represented by a **[zone](../../Challenges-Conflicts-and-Contests/Setting-Up-Scenes/Zones.md)**. This can add extra dynamism to your group’s interactions with the map. A GM can encourage this by making an “up for grabs” free invoke available on a zone aspect at the start of the scene, drawing characters (player and non-player alike) to leverage that aspect as part of their early strategy.
