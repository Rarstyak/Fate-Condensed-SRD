### Earning Fate Points

One way you can earn fate points is by letting your character’s aspects be **[compelled](../Compels/Compels.md)** against you to complicate the situation or make your life harder. You may also get a fate point payout if someone uses your aspect against you in a **[hostile invoke](../Invokes/Hostile-Invocations.md)** or when you **[concede](../../../Challenges-Conflicts-and-Contests/Conflicts/Taking-Harm/Conceding.md)**.

Remember, each session, you also start with fate points at least equal to your **[refresh](../../../Getting-Started/Create-Your-Characters/Refresh/Refresh.md)**. If you were compelled more than you invoked in the prior session, you’ll show up at the next one with more.
