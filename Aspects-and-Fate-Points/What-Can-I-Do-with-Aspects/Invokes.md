### Invokes

To unlock the true power of aspects and make them help you, you’ll need to spend **fate points** to **invoke** them during dice rolls (**page XX**). Keep track of your fate points with pennies or glass beads or poker chips or some other tokens.

You can also invoke aspects for free, _if_ you have a free invoke from you or an ally creating an advantage you can use (**page XX**).

#### The Ellipsis Trick

If you want an easy way to ensure you have room to incorporate aspects into a roll, try narrating your action with an ellipsis at the end (“...”), and then finish the action with the aspect you want to invoke. Like this:

Ryan says, “So I’m trying to decipher the runes and...” (rolls the dice, hates the result) “...and **If I Haven’t Been There, I’ve Read About It**...” (spends a fate point) “...so I easily start rambling about their origin.”

#### Hostile Invocations

Most of the time an aspect is invoked, it’s a character aspect or a situation aspect. Sometimes you’ll invoke enemies’ character aspects _against_ them. This is called a **hostile invocation**, and it works just like invoking any other aspect—pay a fate point and get a +2 to your roll or reroll the dice. There’s one small difference—**when you make a hostile invocation, you give the fate point to the enemy.** But they don’t get to use the fate point until after the scene is over. This payout only applies when a fate point is actually spent on a hostile invocation. Free invokes do not trigger a payout.

#### Invoking to Declare Story Details

You may add an important or unlikely detail to the story based on an aspect in play. Don’t spend a fate point when “aspects are always true” (**page XX**) applies. Pay when it’s a stretch—or, table willing, when there’s no relevant aspect.
