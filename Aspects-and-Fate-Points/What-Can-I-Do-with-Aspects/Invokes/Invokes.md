### Invokes

To unlock the true power of aspects and make them help you, you’ll need to spend **fate points** to **[invoke](../../../Taking-Action-Rolling-the-Dice/Modifying-the-Dice/Invoking-Aspects.md)** them during dice rolls. Keep track of your fate points with pennies or glass beads or poker chips or some other tokens.

You can also invoke aspects for free, _if_ you have a free invoke from you or an ally **[creating an advantage](../../../Taking-Action-Rolling-the-Dice/Actions/Create-an-Advantage.md)** you can use.
