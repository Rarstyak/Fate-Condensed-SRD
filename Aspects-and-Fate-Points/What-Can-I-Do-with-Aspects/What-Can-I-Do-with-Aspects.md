## What Can I Do with Aspects?

### Earning Fate Points

One way you can earn fate points is by letting your character’s aspects be **compelled** (**page XX**) against you to complicate the situation or make your life harder. You may also get a fate point payout if someone uses your aspect against you in a hostile invoke (**page XX**) or when you concede (**page XX**).

Remember, each session, you also start with fate points at least equal to your **refresh**. If you were compelled more than you invoked in the prior session, you’ll show up at the next one with more. See **page XX** for details.

### Invokes

To unlock the true power of aspects and make them help you, you’ll need to spend **fate points** to **invoke** them during dice rolls (**page XX**). Keep track of your fate points with pennies or glass beads or poker chips or some other tokens.

You can also invoke aspects for free, _if_ you have a free invoke from you or an ally creating an advantage you can use (**page XX**).

#### The Ellipsis Trick

If you want an easy way to ensure you have room to incorporate aspects into a roll, try narrating your action with an ellipsis at the end (“...”), and then finish the action with the aspect you want to invoke. Like this:

Ryan says, “So I’m trying to decipher the runes and...” (rolls the dice, hates the result) “...and **If I Haven’t Been There, I’ve Read About It**...” (spends a fate point) “...so I easily start rambling about their origin.”

#### Hostile Invocations

Most of the time an aspect is invoked, it’s a character aspect or a situation aspect. Sometimes you’ll invoke enemies’ character aspects _against_ them. This is called a **hostile invocation**, and it works just like invoking any other aspect—pay a fate point and get a +2 to your roll or reroll the dice. There’s one small difference—**when you make a hostile invocation, you give the fate point to the enemy.** But they don’t get to use the fate point until after the scene is over. This payout only applies when a fate point is actually spent on a hostile invocation. Free invokes do not trigger a payout.

#### Invoking to Declare Story Details

You may add an important or unlikely detail to the story based on an aspect in play. Don’t spend a fate point when “aspects are always true” (**page XX**) applies. Pay when it’s a stretch—or, table willing, when there’s no relevant aspect.

### Compels

Aspects can be **compelled** to complicate the situation and earn fate points. To compel an aspect, the GM or a player offers a fate point to the player whose character is being compelled, and tells them why an aspect is making things more difficult or complicated. If you refuse the compel, you must spend a fate point from your own supply and describe how your character avoids the complication. Yes, this means that if you don’t have any fate points, you can’t refuse a compel!

**Any aspect can be compelled**—whether it’s a character aspect, situation aspect, or consequence—but it must be something that affects the character being compelled.

**Anyone can offer a compel.** The player proposing the compel must spend one of their own fate points. The GM then takes over running the compel for the affected target. The GM does not lose a fate point by offering a compel—they have a limited pool of fate points for invoking aspects, but can compel as much as they’d like.

**Compels can be retroactive.** If a player finds they have roleplayed themself into a complication related to one of their aspects or a situation aspect that concerns them, they can ask the GM if that counts as a **self-compel**. If the group agrees, the GM slides the player a fate point.

**It’s okay to recognize a compel as off-the-mark and withdraw it.** If the group agrees that a proposed compel wasn’t appropriate, it should be withdrawn at no cost to the compelled character.

#### Compels Are Complications, Not Stymies

When offering a compel, make sure that the complication is a course of action or major change in circumstance, not a denial of options.

“Oh, you’ve got sand in your eyes, so you shoot at the creature and miss,” is not a compel. It denies action rather than complicating anything.

“You know, curse your luck, I think that the sand in your eyes means you can’t really see anything. Your shots at the shoggoth go wild, puncturing a few barrels that are now gushing gasoline toward the fire pit.” This is a much better compel. It changes the scene, ratchets up the tension, and gives the players something new to think about.

For some ideas about what does and doesn’t work as a compel, check out the discussion of types of compels found in _Fate Core System_ starting on page 72 of that book, or online at: [_https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/invoking-compelling-aspects#types-of-compels_](https://www.faterpg.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Fate-Condensed-SRD-CC-BY.html)

#### Events and Decisions

There are two general kinds of compels: **events** and **decisions**.

An event compel is something that happens to a character because of an external force. That external force connects with the aspect in some way, resulting in an unfortunate complication.

A decision compel is internal, where the character’s flaws or competing values get in the way of better judgment. The aspect guides the character to make a particular choice—and the fallout of that choice creates a complication for them.

In either case, a resulting complication is key! Without a complication, there is no compel.

#### Hostile Invocations or Compels?

Don’t confuse hostile invocations and compels! Though they are similar—they are ways to give a character an immediate problem in exchange for a fate point—they work differently.

A compel creates a _narrative change_. The decision to compel a character’s aspect isn’t something that happens in-universe; rather, it’s the GM or player proposing a change to the story. The effect can be broad, but the target gets the fate point immediately if they accept the compel, and may choose to refuse the compel.

A hostile invocation is a _mechanical effect_. The target doesn’t get a chance to refuse the invocation—but as with any invocation, you will need to explain how that aspect makes sense to invoke. And while they do get a fate point, they don’t get to use it in the current scene. However, the ultimate result is much more constrained: a +2 bonus or one reroll of the dice.

Compels let you, as a player or GM, change what a scene is _about_. They throw a wrench in the narrative. Using them against an opponent is a risky proposition—they might refuse, or accomplish their objective despite the complication thanks to the shiny new fate point you handed them.

Hostile invocations help you in the current moment. In addition to your own aspects, you have your opponent’s aspects available to invoke, giving you more options and making scenes more dynamic and connected.
