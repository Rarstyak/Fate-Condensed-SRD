### Compels

Aspects can be **compelled** to complicate the situation and earn fate points. To compel an aspect, the GM or a player offers a fate point to the player whose character is being compelled, and tells them why an aspect is making things more difficult or complicated. If you refuse the compel, you must spend a fate point from your own supply and describe how your character avoids the complication. Yes, this means that if you don’t have any fate points, you can’t refuse a compel!

**Any aspect can be compelled**—whether it’s a character aspect, situation aspect, or consequence—but it must be something that affects the character being compelled.

**Anyone can offer a compel.** The player proposing the compel must spend one of their own fate points. The GM then takes over running the compel for the affected target. The GM does not lose a fate point by offering a compel—they have a limited pool of fate points for invoking aspects, but can compel as much as they’d like.

**Compels can be retroactive.** If a player finds they have roleplayed themself into a complication related to one of their aspects or a situation aspect that concerns them, they can ask the GM if that counts as a **self-compel**. If the group agrees, the GM slides the player a fate point.

**It’s okay to recognize a compel as off-the-mark and withdraw it.** If the group agrees that a proposed compel wasn’t appropriate, it should be withdrawn at no cost to the compelled character.
