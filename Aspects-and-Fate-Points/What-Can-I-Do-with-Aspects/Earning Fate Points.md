### Earning Fate Points

One way you can earn fate points is by letting your character’s aspects be **compelled** (**page XX**) against you to complicate the situation or make your life harder. You may also get a fate point payout if someone uses your aspect against you in a hostile invoke (**page XX**) or when you concede (**page XX**).

Remember, each session, you also start with fate points at least equal to your **refresh**. If you were compelled more than you invoked in the prior session, you’ll show up at the next one with more. See **page XX** for details.
