### Situation Aspects

These aspects describe the surroundings or scenario where the action is taking place. A situation aspect usually vanishes at the end of the scene it was part of, or when someone takes some action that would change or get rid of it. Essentially, they last only as long as the situation they represent lasts.

**Examples:**Â **On Fire; Bright Sunlight; Crowd of Angry People; Knocked to the Ground; Pursued by the Police**
