### Character Aspects

These aspects are on your character sheet, such as your high concept and trouble. They describe personality traits, important details about your past, relationships you have with others, important items or titles you possess, problems you’re dealing with or goals you’re working toward, or reputations and obligations you carry. These aspects primarily change during **[milestones](../../Advancement/Milestones.md)**.

**Examples:** **Leader of My Band of Survivors; Attention to Detail; I Must Protect My Brother**
