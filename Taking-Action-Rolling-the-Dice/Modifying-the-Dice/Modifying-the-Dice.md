## Modifying the Dice

You may modify your dice by invoking aspects to get +2 to your roll or reroll the dice. Some stunts also give you a bonus. You may also invoke aspects to **[support an ally](../../Challenges-Conflicts-and-Contests/Teamwork/Teamwork.md)** or to increase the difficulty an enemy faces.
