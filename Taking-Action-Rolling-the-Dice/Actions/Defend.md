### Defend

Defend to survive an attack or interfere with a foe’s action.

Is a monster trying to eat your face? Is a foe pushing you out of the way as they flee your wrath? What about when that cultist tries to stab you in both kidneys? **Defend**, defend, defend.

Defend is the only reactive action in _Fate Condensed_. You use it to stop something from happening outside your turn, so you’re often facing an opposing roll rather than a set difficulty. Your enemy rolls, and you immediately roll to defend, so long as you’re the target or can justify your opposition (which often makes you the target). Aspects or stunts may provide justification.

Your outcomes when defending are:

- **[If you fail,](../Outcomes/Failure.md)** against an attack, you take a hit, which you must absorb with **[stress](../../Challenges-Conflicts-and-Contests/Conflicts/Taking-Harm/Stress.md)** or **[consequences](../../Challenges-Conflicts-and-Contests/Conflicts/Taking-Harm/Consequences.md)**. Regardless, the enemy succeeds as described for their action.
- **[If you tie,](../Outcomes/Tie.md)** proceed according to the tie result for the opposed action.
- **[If you succeed,](../Outcomes/Success.md)** you don’t take a hit or you deny the enemy’s action.
- **[If you succeed with style,](../Outcomes/Success-with-Style.md)** you don’t take a hit, you deny the enemy’s action, and you even get a boost as you gain the upper hand for a moment.

Continuing from the previous example, the corpse gets to defend itself against Ruth. The GM rolls `[-][0][0][+]`, which doesn’t change the creature’s Mediocre (+0) Athletics.

Because Ruth’s effort was higher, her attack succeeds by two shifts, and the corpse is a little closer to being down for good. Had the corpse rolled better, then its defense would have succeeded, and the undead monstrosity would have avoided taking a hit.

#### Which skills can be used to attack and defend?

The default list of skills follows these guidelines:

- Fight and Shoot can be used to make physical attacks.
- Athletics can be used to defend against any physical attack.
- Fight can be used to defend against melee physical attacks.
- Provoke can be used to make a mental attack.
- Will can be used to defend against mental attacks.

Other skills may gain permission to attack or defend under special circumstances, as determined by the GM or table consensus. Some stunts may grant broader, guaranteed permission when circumstances might otherwise not do so. When a skill can’t be used to attack or defend but might help with it, prepare for it by using that skill with the create an advantage action, and use the free invokes generated on your next attack or defend roll.
