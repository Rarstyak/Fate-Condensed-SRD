## Outcomes

Whenever you roll dice, the difference between your effort and the target difficulty or opposition is measured in **shifts**. A shift has a value of 1. There are four possible outcomes:

- If your effort is less than the target difficulty or opposition, you **[fail](Failure.md)**.
- If your effort is equal to the target, you **[tie](Tie.md)**.
- If your effort is one or two shifts more than the target, you **[succeed](Success.md)**.
- If your effort is three or more shifts more than the target, you **[succeed with style](Success-with-Style.md)**.

Some outcomes are obviously better for you than others, but all of them should advance the story in interesting ways. You started with fiction first (**page XX**); make sure you end with it too, to maintain focus on the story, and to ensure you interpret the results in a way that fits the fiction.

Ethan isn’t an adept safe-cracker (though he has the tools), and yet he’s in a sinister cult’s guarded secret headquarters, with a steel door between him and the ritual book he desperately needs. Can he get in?
