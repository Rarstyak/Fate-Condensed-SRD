### Tie

If your effort is equal to the target difficulty or opposition, you tie.

Just like failure, ties should move the story forward, never stymie the action. Something interesting should happen. Similar to failure, this can play out a couple ways: success at a minor cost, or partial success.

#### Success at a minor cost

The first is **success at a minor cost**—a few points of stress, story details about difficulty or complication but aren’t hindrances themselves, and a **[boost](../../Aspects-and-Fate-Points/What-Kinds-of-Aspects-Are-There/Boosts.md)** to the enemy are all minor costs.

Ethan’s first few attempts all fail. By the time he actually gets the door open, dawn has broken, and escape under cover of darkness is impossible. He got what he needed, but his situation is worse now.

#### Partial Success

The other way to handle a tie is **partial success**—you succeeded but only got some of what you wanted.

Ethan can only open the safe door a crack—if the door opens more than an inch, the alarm will sound, and he can’t figure out how to disengage that. He manages to pull a couple pages of the ritual out through the narrow gap, but he’ll have to guess at the final steps.
