# Advancement

As your characters muck about in the storyline, they’ll grow and change. At the end of each session you’ll earn a **milestone**, which lets you move things around on your character sheet. As you conclude each arc of the story, you’ll earn a **breakthrough**, which lets you add things to your character sheet. (Learn more about **[sessions and arcs](Sessions-and-Arcs.md)**.)
