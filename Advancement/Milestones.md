## Milestones

Milestones happen at the end of a session, part of the way through dealing with a story arc. They are focused on adjusting your character laterally rather than advancing the character. You may not wish to use a milestone, which is fine. It doesn’t always make sense to change your character. The opportunity is there if you need it.

During a milestone, you can do one of the following:

- Switch the ranks of any two skills, or replace one Average (+1) skill with one that isn’t on your sheet.
- Rewrite one stunt.
- Purchase a new stunt by spending 1 refresh. (Remember, you can’t go below 1 refresh.)
- Rewrite any one of your aspects, except your high concept.
