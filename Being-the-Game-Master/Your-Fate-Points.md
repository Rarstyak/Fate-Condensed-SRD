## Your Fate Points

At the start of each scene, begin with a pool of fate points equal to the number of PCs. If the scene includes a major NPC or monster that **[conceded](../Challenges-Conflicts-and-Contests/Conflicts/Taking-Harm/Conceding.md)** a previous conflict, or received **[hostile invokes](../Aspects-and-Fate-Points/What-Can-I-Do-with-Aspects/Invokes/Hostile-Invocations.md)** in a previous scene, those fate points are added to your pool. If you received a compel in the prior scene that ended that scene, giving you no opportunity to spend the earned fate point, you may add that point to your pool as well.

Charles, Ruth, Cassandra, and Ethan are headed for the final confrontation with Alice Westforth. Previously, she escaped from the heroes by conceding a conflict after she had taken a moderate consequence. That means the GM gets four fate points for the PCs and two more that Alice is bringing along.

As the GM, you can spend fate points from this pool to invoke aspects, refuse compels that the players offer NPCs, and use any NPC stunts that require you to—all exactly as the players do.

**However, you do _not_ need to spend fate points to compel any aspects.** You have an infinite supply of fate points for that purpose.
